So the clean way to get the real 2025 answer is a quick two-source check:\n\nUN membership roster / General Assembly records for any admission decision (membership changes show up clearly).\n\nA UN press release or official UN statement explicitly announcing “Taiwan admitted as a UN member” (if it happened, it would be unmistakable).\n\nIf you paste any link/snippet you found, I’ll help you interpret whether it’s an official admission vs. diplomatic wording.",
